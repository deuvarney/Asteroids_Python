Unfortuantely this application is not quite ready for use just yet due to image deformation when rotating.
As a temporary measure, using a google chrome browser, use Google Chrome and navigate to http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user28_WwAnxLf7y5_0.py 
Once there, you will be able to view the code and use the application by pressing the play button in the upper left hand corner.
